**Firmware Engineer | Computer Engineering Student @ University of Florida**

Hi, I'm Eli! I am a passionate engineer specializing in **Embedded Systems**, **C++**, and **Low-level Programming**. I enjoy building tools that bridge the gap between hardware and software, from custom CPU designs on FPGAs to firmware testing automation tools for enterprise servers.

## Experience

- **Lenovo:** Firmware Engineer (Part-Time & Intern)
- **Georgia Tech Research Institute:** Embedded System Intern
- **University of Florida:** Undergraduate Research Assistant

## Key Projects

- **Reflexion:** Wearable physical therapy device (Best Hardware Hack @ PennApps).
- **Echo Hand:** VR Haptic Glove utilizing ESP32 and RTOS.
- **Custom CPU:** 8-bit CPU built from scratch using VHDL and Intel Quartus.

## About This Website

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio. The design features a **retro CRT terminal aesthetic**, utilizing scanlines, phosphor glow, and "boot up" animations to reflect my love for hardware and early computing interfaces.

**Built With:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
